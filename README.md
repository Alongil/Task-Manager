# Task-Manager

A task management application that allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks.

## Project Overview

 - Utilizes Bootstrap for design
 - Includes four pages: login, home, tasks, and add/edit task pages.
 - Login page allows for user verification through a mock API.
 - Home page greets the user.
 - Tasks page displays all of the user's tasks, allows for task filtering by completion status, editing and deletion of tasks, and filtering the number of displayed  -     tasks per page.
 - Add/Edit Task page presents a form for inserting and updating tasks.

## Disclaimers
 - Initially, the project was designed as if the API was a real server. However, as the project progressed, it became more complex to make API calls while keeping the data on the screen updated, leading to changes in the code that could have been improved.
 - As per the project instructions, there should be an option to display a limited number of tasks in the table. In this implementation, the user has the option to choose between 5, 10, or 20 tasks, however, pagination has not been implemented.
 - The application currently does not have a strong security setup as it is developed with a mock API that does not support a secure authentication process. To ensure the protection of user data in a production environment, additional measures such as the implementation of JWT tokens and the use of a secure database would be necessary

Overall, the task was enjoyable and I would be happy to discuss it further in person. Thank you for the opportunity.
